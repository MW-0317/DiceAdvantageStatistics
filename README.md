# DiceAdvantageStatistics

For the past couple months I have wondered how I'd calculate the statistics of the D&D character creation rolls (rolling four dice and removing the lowest) and through some random tests I found that it was around 1 number higher than just rolling 3 dice (12.5 vs 11.5). However these outcomes were from random statistics and now solidified and repeatable math. And since I haven't found a way to reliably create these combinations in math, and removing one, I have created an algorithm to do it for me. Already proving in some mathematical sense, since it uses the same summation however does it in thousanths of a second, that rolling four dice and keeping three has the average outcome of 12.2446. All without random and just pure combination math. I'm sure this has been done before but I wanted to challenge myself since I wasn't finding anything online.
